        "your_money": { "@type": "FiscalShield", "truth": "The financial cost is absorbed by the plaintiff. The doctrine shields the individual officer from financial responsibility, shifting the burden of damages onto the taxpayer (via government insurance/settlements) or dismissing the case entirely." },
        "your_life": { "@type": "BioSafety", "truth": "The biological cost is the institutionalization of impunity. By protecting officials from civil consequence, it structurally guarantees that bad actors remain in positions of power, increasing the risk of violence and rights violations." },
        "your_time": { "@type": "TimeMetric", "truth": "The doctrine functions as an early dismissal filter. It minimizes the state's temporal cost in court by terminating civil suits at the summary judgment stage before expensive discovery or trial preparation begins." },
        "our_world": { "@type": "PlanetaryImpact", "truth": "The primary output is the Erosion of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. It renders the promise of civil rights and due process unenforceable against state actors, creating a de facto legal caste system." },

If the plaintiff wins, the new ruling establishes the law, but the winning plaintiff receives no damages because the law wasn't 'clearly established' when the harm occurred." }

                <strong>The Definition:</strong> A special legal rule that stops you from suing government workers (like police) for breaking your rights. You can only sue them if a court has <strong>already ruled</strong> that their <strong>exact specific action</strong> was illegal in a past case.
            </div>

                    <h3>Your Money</h3>
                    <p>The victim pays the price. Even if your rights were violated, this rule often means the case gets thrown out, so you get <strong>zero compensation</strong> for your injuries or losses.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="pillar-box">
                    <h3>Your Life</h3>
                    <p>It keeps dangerous people in power. Because it is so hard to punish bad behavior, reckless officials face <strong>no consequences</strong>. This means they are free to stay on the job and potentially hurt others.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="pillar-box">
                    <h3>Your Time</h3>
                    <p>The legal system uses this rule as a shortcut. Instead of a long trial to find the truth, judges use this rule to <strong>dismiss cases immediately</strong>, saving the government time but denying you a fair hearing.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="pillar-box">
                    <h3>Our World</h3>
                    <p>It makes the Constitution optional. If police cannot be punished for violating the rules, then the rules <strong>do not really exist</strong>. This creates a system where government agents are above the law.</p>

                    <h3>The Experience (System Flaw)</h3>
                    <p>The problem is a <strong>No-Win Loop</strong> . You lose your case because there isn't a past case just like yours. But because you lose, your case cannot become the "past case" that helps the next victim.</p>
